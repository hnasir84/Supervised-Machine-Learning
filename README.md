# Supervised-Machine-Learning

In this project, I built a machine learning model that attempts to predict whether a loan will be approved or not.

## Background
Lending services companies allow individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market. This data will be used to
You will be using this data to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically, you will be comparing the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.

## Models applied
1- LogisticRegression 
2- RandomForest Classifier

## Fit a LogisticRegression model and RandomForestClassifier model
Created a LogisticRegression model, fit it to the data, and print the model's score. Do the same for a RandomForestClassifier. You may choose any starting hyperparameters you like. Which model performed better? How does that compare to your prediction? 

Explained my prediction in a markdown cell on Jupyter Notebook.
